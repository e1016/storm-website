    <p>
      Storm for React Native (in diference to <a href="/">web versi√≥n</a>) use AsyncStorage, this has a particular property, as the name says: it is Asynchronous.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      This is the reason because this version use Promises, it is not the substitute for a database, Storm is designed to help in the structuring of temporal data. It is not recommended to save files with encode in base64.
